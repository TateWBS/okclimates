# Why is this project public?
- The business owner had poor communication and hasn't paid our invoice! Once this invoice is paid then this repository will go private.
- This would have been a really short and sweet project to work on and finish, but sadly that wasn't the case. (Some really cool ideas were going to be implemented).
- Please **do not** go in searching for this business to harass, they are good people!
- I feel there is no need to keep this repository hidden from the world if another person can use it!
